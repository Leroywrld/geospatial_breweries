## Welcome

### Geospatial Data Analysis & Machine Learning

This project contains data about breweries located in the following nations:
United States of America
England
Austria
France
Ireland
Poland
Portugal
Scotland
S. Korea
Isle of Man

This dataset may be helpful in geospatial applications when trying to understand strategic locations to establish new breweries that match an area's population demand.
This whole project will incorporate the use of several python libraries like Pandas,Numpy,Matplotlib and Seaborn to clean,analyse and visualzie the geospatial data to gain insights from the data
The steps followed to work on this data:
       Step 1: Data Preparation
Loading the dataset into a pandas Dataframe
Data cleaning and preprocessing.    
    
       Step 2: Geospatial Analysis
Perform exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA) to understand spatial patterns, distributions, and correlations.
Calculate summary statistics for different geographic areas.
Analysis to identify areas with high population demand for breweries.

       Step 3: Feature Engineering
Using K-Means to group breweries based on geographical proximity
Cluster breweries to identify potential brewering hotspots with unmet demands.

       Step 4: Machine Learning Modeling
Spliting the data into training and testing sets.
Using Machine Learning algorithm to predict demand based on historical demographic data.
Building a recommendation engine to suggest optimal locations for establishing new breweries.

       Step 5: Model Interpretation
Interpreting the model's results.
Visualizing model predictions on maps.

       Step 6: Spatial Data Visualization and Reporting
Generating reports that summarize the  geospatial analysis and machine learning results

       Step 7: Deployment 
Deploying a predictive model to integrate it into the application or system.
(This will help to Monitor and maintain the model's performance over time )

       Step 8: Documentation 
Documening the entire workflow, including data sources, preprocessing steps, modeling choices, and results.
